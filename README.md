# NextGen Partner Feedback

This is the central place for our partners to share feedback, report bugs, suggest improvements, or ask questions about the NextGen platform.

Your input—whether technical or not—is essential to helping us improve the platform. We welcome all observations from your testing experience.

## How to Submit Feedback

1. **Review existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Provide a clear and specific title (e.g., “Login fails after password reset” or “Suggestion: Add export button to dashboard”).
4. In the description, include:
   - What you were trying to do
   - What happened (or what you’d like to see)
   - Any relevant details (e.g., browser, device, steps taken, screenshots if possible)
5. Submit the issue. The NextGen team will review it and apply appropriate tags (e.g., bug, enhancement, question) for tracking.
